# DGM-Interface-Design
Interface design, utilizing bootstrap, for a school project.

4/25/17 - completed a rough outline of the web application's design.
        - notes: need to research input validation and error checking.

4/30/17 - added the onclick attribute to the submit buttons in both the studentLogin and employeeLogin pages. This will allow us to demo the button.
